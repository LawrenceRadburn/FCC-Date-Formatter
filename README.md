# Date-Formatter

# Follow Along Project Description:
Working with dates in JavaScript can be challenging. You have to navigate various methods, formats, and time zones. In this project, you'll learn how to work with the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. You'll also learn how to correctly format dates.

This project will cover concepts such as the getDate(), getMonth(), and getFullYear() methods.

# Scope of the Project

The HTML and CSS files were provided by freeCodeCamp. As a result, I only worked through the JavaScript from scratch.

# What I Learned

## Embedded Expressions to format dates
Using embedded expressions inside template literals, I formatted the .getDate() method to a day/month/year format

## split() method
I used to split() method to take a string and return an array of one element.
Additionally, the split() method can take parameters, known as separators. I used an empty string as a separator to separate each letter of a string.

## reverse() method
Alongside the split() method, I used the reverse() method to reverse the order of the values inside an array.

## join() method
Finally, I chained a join() method on an array alongside the split() and reverse() methods. The join() method also takes a parameter known as a separator.
